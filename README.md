Algerian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) Prediction
Developed a predictive model to forecast the Forest Weather Index (FWI) for forest fires in Algeria using historical weather data. Utilized machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Linear Regression for predictive modeling. Performed data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation to optimize prediction accuracy.
